# PDDL domain V&V framework
A tool to simulate PDDL domains (with given problem descriptions). Starting from an initial state defined
by the problem, the tool displays enabled actions and traverses the state space depending upon selected
action. Simultaneously, it shows the updated knowledge base with the deleted and added predicates which
can help in debugging the problems with the domain file.

The project is a Visual Studio C# project on the .NET framework. The .sln file is in the PDDLPlanning folder.
