# Moveit Config #
This package provides configuration files for moveit!. It was generated using MoveIt! [setup assistant](http://docs.ros.org/indigo/api/moveit_tutorials/html/doc/setup_assistant/setup_assistant_tutorial.html) and tailored to work with V-REP ROS controller using as an example the [Interbotix repo](https://github.com/Interbotix/phantomx_pincher_arm).

Package main components are located inside _launch_ and _config_ directory. _Launch_ folder has several files to run Robot's and MoveIt! nodes. The main launch file is robot_simu.launch and it will call all the others _launch_ and config files. Inside _config_ folder, it's nice to pay attention to phantomXPincher\_moveit.yaml that contains the controller's configuration. The _multi.launch_ is an example of how o use many robots.

## MoveIt! Concepts ##
In general, MoveIt! uses robot's URDF to know about robot's configuration, sensors, and actuators. With this information, MoveIt! is capable of planning trajectories, avoid collisions (within the robot and the environment), solve inverse kinematics and so on. To interact with MoveIt! there are interfaces available in C++, Python and rviz provide a GUI interface.

More details can be found at [MoveIt! concepts](http://moveit.ros.org/documentation/concepts/).


## MoveIt! Launch Files ##

A detailed description about launch files could be helpful on understanding how MoveIt! components are connected to robot's components.


##How to run - Basic example##

This basic example uses rviz to control the arm.

To work properly this package need the following packages: phantomx\_pincher\_arm\_vrep\_controller and phantomx\_pincher\_arm\_description.

1. Follow the instructions of phantomx\_pincher\_arm\_vrep\_controller README.md and check if it's working
1. Source packages files:
   - on the packages inside phantomx\_pincher\_arm do for each one: `$ source devel/setup.bash`
1. Start roscore
   - on a terminal:
     `$ roscore`
1. Start vrep and load the scene on vrep/turttlebot2\_v4.ttt inside phantomx\_pincher\_arm package
   - It's possible to start vrep in headless mode with.
     - Inside V-REP root folder run:
       `$ ./vrep.sh -h -s -q <PATH_TO_phantomx_pincher_arm_vrep_controller>/vrep/turttlebot2\_v4.ttt`
1. On a new terminal start one_robot.launch
   - on a terminal:
     	`$ roslaunch phantomx_pincher_arm_moveit one_robot.launch`
1. If it's everything ok, after while a rviz window will open with a 3D visualization of the arm
1. Control the arm using rviz
   - In the tab _path planning_ inside the moveit! panel it's possible to plan and move the arm to a new position.

##How to run - Pick and Place example##

This example show how to execute a pick and place task

**From here the instruction are the as on section above**

To work properly this package need the following packages: phantomx\_pincher\_arm\_vrep\_controller and phantomx\_pincher\_arm\_description.

1. Follow the instructions of phantomx\_pincher\_arm\_vrep\_controller README.md and check if it's working
1. Source packages files:
   - on the packages inside phantomx\_pincher\_arm do for each one: `$ source devel/setup.bash`

     - Inside V-REP root folder run:
       `$ ./vrep.sh -h -s -q <PATH_TO_phantomx_pincher_arm_vrep_controller>/vrep/turttlebot2\_v4.ttt`
1. On a new terminal start one_robot.launch
   - on a terminal:
     	`$ roslaunch phantomx_pincher_arm_moveit one_robot.launch`
1. If it's everything ok, after while a rviz window will open with a 3D visualization of the arm

** Until here the instructions are the same. From now one it's a new way to control the arm **

1. On the folder _scripts_ he have:
   - `pick_action_server.py`: runs a action server that will control the arm to do pickup a box
     - input: the object name to be picked
   - `pick_client.py`: a sample client that add two object to scene and request the robot to perform a pick
   - `place_action_server.py`: runs a action server that will control the arm to place a box
     - input: the position to place the object
   - `pick_client.py`: a sample client that request the robot to perform a place

1. Start the pick_action_server
   - python pick_action_server.py

1. Start the client
   - python pick_client.py

1. Wait for Pickup task be executed. Check the monitor the terminal output to figure out what's happening.
   - Result:
      - The arm will open the gripper
      - Go to object position
      - Close the gripper

1. Start the place_action_server
   - python place_action_server.py

1. Start the client
   - python place_client.py

1. Wait for the place task be executed. Check the monitor the terminal output to figure out what's happening.
   - Result:
      - The arm will go to some place
      - Gripper will open
      - The arm will retreat from the object


##Know Issues##

The present solution has a poor performance using other IK solver than trac.

#TO-DO#

[ ] Add pick and place action server to a launch file
[ ] Test pick and place for multiple robots
[ ] Improve how to pick an object
[ ] Improve modularity on action servers scripts
[ ] Eliminate some prints and use roslog properly
[ ] Improve control .cpp file
  - roslog usage
  - remoteAPI checkup
[ ] Robot name inside turtlebot2i.srdf must be one for only the arm and for the arm+mobile_base
[ ] phantomx_pincher_arm.urdf.xacro must be the same for only the arm and for the arm+mobile_base
