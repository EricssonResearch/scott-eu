#     Based on example.launch, and was adjusted for Scott.
# Configuration for subscribers to cmd_vel sources. 
#
# Typically automatic controllers, as ROS navigation stack should have the minimum priority
# Safety controller and Keyboard operation have higher priority.
# 
# Note: this is only for one robot! Need to find a way for multiple robots.
# Individual subscriber configuration:
#   name:           Source name
#   topic:          The topic that provides cmd_vel messages
#   timeout:        Time in seconds without incoming messages to consider this topic inactive
#   priority:       Priority: an UNIQUE unsigned integer from 0 (lowest) to MAX_INT 
#   short_desc:     Short description (optional)
