Make sure you have following files in your directory, in order to run the various examples:

1. vrep.py
2. the appropriate remote API library: "remoteApi.dll" (Windows), "remoteApi.dylib" (Mac) or **"remoteApi.so" (Linux)**
3. screenshoot_remotAPI.py
4. screenshotSensor.lua

Add a screenshotSensor in V-REP model, and edit its Lua script by **Adding screenshotSensor.lua**

Please note:
1. ** The images are very large: about 7MB**
2. Saving one image takes several seconds. It is slow!
